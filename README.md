# simple_webpage

this is very simple html with css and icons, pictures, videos. it has only 1 script functions for login that will redirect to another page if the ID and password is correct. however, it does not have any registration changes as it has no database. all information is made up.

the zip file is just the whole thing packaged. the main page is the home.htm. the view will slightly differ for different browser.
